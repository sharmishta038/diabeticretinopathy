# 🩺 Deep Learning Fundus Image Analysis for Early Detection of Diabetic Retinopathy

## 📌 Project Overview

Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is a diabetes complication that affects the eyes and can lead to blindness if not detected early.  
This project uses **Deep Learning and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** to automatically detect Diabetic Retinopathy from retinal fundus images.

The goal of this project is to assist in early diagnosis and improve medical screening efficiency using Artificial Intelligence.
